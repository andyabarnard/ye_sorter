# ye_sorter
A simple script that sorts files into alphabetical folders

To use: put it in a directory and run it.  It'll go through every file in its current directory and sort them.

Can create folders for files or create every folder in the alphabet, choose between generic and per-number folders, create folders in upper or lower case, and that's about it.  

If a file name begins with one or more non-alphanumeric characters, they will be ignored.  If a file name consists entirely of non-alphanumeric characters, the file itself will be ignored.  I might change the former behavior if there's enough demand for it (as in, literally any).

I made this one evening because it was faster than manually sorting a bunch of files.  Enjoy it if you feel like it might help.  I tested it pretty thoroughly, but I can make no guarantees that it won't behave unexpectedly outside of a Windows 11 setting.
